# Model-Interpretability
In this, we interpreted Machine Learning Models on the bank-additional dataset.
When interpreting machine learning models, the approach chosen should consider the specific requirements and trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. LIME and SHAP are popular methods for interpreting black-box models, with LIME being lightweight and suitable for certain use cases, and SHAP being more stable and theoretically sound but requiring more computational resources. PDP and SHAP differ in their approach to analyzing variable contributions to the output, with PDP being useful for understanding the effect of a single variable on the output, while SHAP shows the contribution of each variable to the output. The best method to use ultimately depends on the specific goals and needs of the project at hand.
